# Rick and Morty Library

This project is created as part of the interview process at Leonardo.ai

It's also my first time using nextJS and ChakraUI. I must admit i spent more than the recommended 2 hours, but it was a great learning experience for me :) 

server side vs client side plus the breaking changes was quite challenging. If I had more time to redo things, I would:
- Use an actual database for more secure auth system
- change the layout configuration. The login page layout should be the nested one, in a nested 'login' page folder.
- Do a better theme for chakraUI that fit the rick and morty brand
- Do a better pagination and filter
- Fix the modal URL not loading the background on refresh
- use less client components
- allow user to select view mode (table vs grid vs list)
